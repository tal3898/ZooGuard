This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This project is a web UI for zookeeper data. It is easier to know what nodes are saved in your zoo, their data, their meta data...
with simple UI viewer.

## Configuration

In the `.env` file, there is a configuration file `ZOOKEEPER_URL`, with the url of the zookeeper. 

Just change it to your zookeeper url, and start it :)
